## Collaboration

Step 1. Install **Git**, **Node.js (>=20.x)**, and **Yarn**.

Step 2. Clone the project and install necessary node modules

```sh
git clone git@github.com:receptron/graphai.git
yarn install
```

Step 3. Set the environment variable OPENAI_API_KEY to your own key (=sk-...)

You need to set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY as well, if you want to use Claude.

**IMPORTANT: Replace <your-openai-api-key> with your actual OpenAI API key**
```sh
touch .env
echo "export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key>" > .env
```

Step 4. Run the test script

Run the test

```sh
yarn run test
```

Step 5. Run one of the sample scripts

```sh
cd packages/samples/
yarn run sample ./src/tools/home.ts
```

Step 6. Write some code and send pull requests

- Please run "yarn run format" before sending your pull request.
- Please do not include any build files (files under /lib) in your pull request.

Key principles:

1. Keep the core (Node and GraphAI classes) small and simple.
2. Enhance the platform by adding 'agents' (plugins).
3. Simple but effective test scripts make it easy to maintain.


## ðŸ”„ Pull Request Guidelines
- Base your PR on the main branch.
- Keep PRs small and focused (one feature or fix per PR).
- Add clear descriptions for changes.

## ðŸ§¹ Code Style

- Follow ESLint and Prettier rules.
- Do not use `any`.
- Avoid using `let`; prefer `const` whenever possible.
- Minimize type casting as much as possible.

## ðŸ”€ Git Workflow

- Do not use `--force`; progress with `merge`.
- In a monorepo setup, add only necessary npm dependencies to each package.
  All other dependencies should be added to the root `package.json`.
