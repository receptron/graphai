# Async/Await is Not All You Need

The async/await pattern became a feature of many programming languages, such as C#, C++, Dart, Kotlin, Rust, Python, TypeScript/JavaScript, and Swift. It allows an asynchronous, non-blocking function to be structured in a way similar to an ordinary synchronous function.

While it is quite convenient, it is not suitable to perform multiple asynchronous tasks concurrently.

For example, the following TypeScript code will execute TaskA and TaskB sequentially even though they are independent.

```typescript
const TaskRunner = async () => {
  const a = await TaskA();
  const b = await TaskB();
  const c = await TaskC(a, b);
};
```

To perform TaskA and TaskB concurrently, you need to use Promise.all.

```typescript
const TaskRunner = async () => {
  const [a, b] = await Promise.all(TaskA(), TaskB());
  const c = await TaskC(a, b);
};
```

This technique is fine for simple cases, but will become harder for complex cases like this (if you are an experienced TypeScript developer, try to fully optimize it before reading further):

```typescript
const TaskRunner = async () => {
  const a = await TaskA();
  const b = await TaskB();
  const c = await TaskC();
  const d = await TaskD(a, b);
  const e = await TaskE(b, c);
  return TaskF(d, e);
};
```

I tested this quiz with developers on X and a few other developer forums, and many developers, even experienced ones, came up with this answer:

```typescript
const TaskRunner = async () => {
  const [a, b, c] = await Promise.all([TaskA(), TaskB(), TaskC()]);
  const [d, e] = await Promise.all([TaskD(a, b), TaskE(b, c)]);
  return TaskF(d, e);
};
```

While it performs much better than the original code, this is not optimal. TaskD needs to wait for TaskC even though it does not have to, and TaskE needs to wait for TaskA even though it does not have to.

When I pointed out this issue, one developer came up with the following answer, noticing the fact that both TaskD and TaskE need to wait for TaskB to be completed.

```typescript
const TaskRunner = async () => {
  const promiseA = TaskA();
  const promiseC = TaskC();
  const b = await TaskB();
  const AthenD = async () => {
    const a = await promiseA;
    return TaskD(a, b);
  };
  const CthenE = async () => {
    const c = await promiseC;
    return TaskE(b, c);
  };
  const [d, e] = await Promise.all([AthenD(), CthenE()]);
  return TaskF(d, e);
};
```

While it is fully optimized, this style of code is very hard to read, and it does not scale. It is impossible to write the optimal code with tens of asynchronous tasks.

To solve this problem, I propose "data-flow programming", treating tasks as nodes of an acyclic data-flow graph and describing dependencies among them.

With a data-flow programming style, the code will look like this:

```typescript
import { computed } from "@receptron/graphai_lite";

const ExecuteAtoF = async () => {
  const nodeA = computed([], TaskA);
  const nodeB = computed([], TaskB);
  const nodeC = computed([], TaskC);
  const nodeD = computed([nodeA, nodeB], TaskD);
  const nodeE = computed([nodeB, nodeC], TaskE);
  const nodeF = computed([nodeD, nodeE], TaskF);
  return nodeF;
};
```

`computed()` is a thin wrapper of Promise.all (defined in [@receptron/graphai_lite](https://github.com/receptron/graphai/tree/main/packages/lite#readme)), which creates a "computed node" from an array of input nodes and an asynchronous function.

`const nodeD = computed([nodeA, nodeB], TaskD);` indicates `nodeD` is the node representing `taskD` and it requires data from `nodeA` and `nodeB`.

With this style, you don't need to specify the execution order. You just need to specify the data dependencies among nodes, and the system will automatically figure out the right order, concurrently executing independent tasks.
